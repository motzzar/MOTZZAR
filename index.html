                <!-- Your full letter remains here exactly as before -->
                Hello dear, how’s it going? You must be fine, I think. I’m good too. As you said about my sleep and
                going to bed early, I’ve been keeping that promise for the last few days. I go to bed before 2 AM now.
                I’m trying to fix my sleep schedule because it’s necessary for health, you know. And I’m glad that you
                cared about it. But that’s not the main thing I want to talk about. That was just a shift of activities
                — it may change. Let’s talk about you first. Overall, what I’ve seen in these days while spending time
                with you… you’re pretty. But what makes you even more beautiful to me is the artist in you. I love your
                portraits — would you give me one someday? Your innocence when you talk is so pure… until you switch to
                that naughty mind, hehe. And those little sparks when I do some “chapati talks.” And your laugh? Ahhhh…
                I swear, it’s my favorite sound. Would you send me a voice note of you laughing uncontrollably? Pretty,
                talented, innocent, and a little dangerously naughty? That’s an unfair combination you’ve got.
                Impressive. Do you remember how we met? Suppose if I hadn’t clicked to join your team, or if you had
                kicked me out, we wouldn’t have come this far — and you wouldn’t be reading this right now. When I asked
                for your Instagram, you said yes, and we got connected. From that day, we spent time together in the
                game whenever we got the chance. On Instagram, I confessed what I felt about you. Then somehow, after
                being present for a day or two, we got disconnected — I don’t know how. Then suddenly, on 8th February,
                we got a chance to spend time together again. I told you again that I like you, and you said you would
                be with me. Our conversation shifted to family, interests, and it felt like we were planning to be
                together. And then you asked for my number. I thought you were getting serious about this, so I gave it
                to you. On 8th, 9th, and 10th February, we talked on calls for three straight days. I can say those were
                the most consecutive days I’ve ever talked to any girl. That’s why your words felt wholehearted to me
                when you told me to sleep early. After that, we chatted. When you called, I asked you to wait. When I
                called back, I found myself blocked (12th Feb). Then I talked to you on Instagram. But I felt something
                was missing. The way you promised me — “Mai reh lungi, tum jab tak kahoge mai reh lungi, zindagi ke anth
                tak reh lungi. Par mujhe zara bhi laga ki tum badal gaye, mai chali jaungi.” That willingness of being
                together feels missing now. I don’t know what you’re going through. But the way things were presented in
                the last moment made me feel heavy inside. See, I’m old enough to understand things. I’ve seen many
                incidents — not just in my life, but around me. So tell me what’s true. As I told you earlier, I won’t
                take it in an improper way. I am a man who thinks, “The beauty of being liked by the one you like is
                unmatched.” And right now, that matching feeling seems missing. To talk with you, I skipped playing
                games. After you weren’t available to talk, I fixed my sleep. I changed some things in myself — with or
                without you. But honestly, I want to do it with you. Let me tell you one thing: I am an overthinker. I
                think too much. I take things in both ways. When you said you blocked my number, I tried to take it in
                an affirmative way. But after the way you presented yourself, it led me into suspicion. So please tell
                me the truth. I will accept it — even if it’s not acceptable to me. As you promised, you have to be
                true. I am killing my time thinking about this. And now I am preparing for something great in my life. I
                need assurance, I include you in it or not? <br><br>
                Waiting for your call...
